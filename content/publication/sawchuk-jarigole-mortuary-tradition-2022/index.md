abstract: ",  The megalithic pillar sites found around Lake Turkana, Kenya, are monumental
  cemeteries built approximately 5000 years ago. Their construction coincides with
  the spread of pastoralism into the region during a period of profound climate change.
  Early work at the Jarigole pillar site suggested that these places were secondary
  burial grounds. Subsequent excavations at other pillar sites, however, have revealed
  planned mortuary cavities for predominantly primary burials, challenging the idea
  that all pillar sites belonged to a single `Jarigole mortuary tradition'. Here,
  the authors report new findings from the Jarigole site that resolve long-standing
  questions about eastern Africa's earliest monuments and provide insight into the
  social lives, and deaths, of the region's first pastoralists."
