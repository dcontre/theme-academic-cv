abstract: Explaining the factors that influence past dietary variation is critically
  important for understanding changes in subsistence, health, and status in past societies;
  yet systematic studies comparing possible driving factors remain scarce. Here we
  compile the largest dataset of past diet derived from stable isotope $δ$13C‰ and
  $δ$15N‰ values in the Americas to quantitatively evaluate the impact of 7000 years
  of climatic and demographic change on dietary variation in the Central Andes. Specifically,
  we couple paleoclimatic data from a general circulation model with estimates of
  relative past population inferred from archaeologically derived radiocarbon dates
  to assess the influence of climate and population on spatiotemporal dietary variation
  using an ensemble machine learning model capable of accounting for interactions
  among predictors. Results reveal that climate and population strongly predict diet
  (80% of $δ$15N‰ and 66% of $δ$13C‰) and that Central Andean diets correlate much
  more strongly with local climatic conditions than regional population size, indicating
  that the past 7000 years of dietary change was influenced more by climatic than
  socio-demographic processes. Visually, the temporal pattern suggests decreasing
  dietary variation across elevation zones during the Late Horizon, raising the possibility
  that sociopolitical factors overrode the influence of local climatic conditions
  on diet during that time. The overall findings and approach establish a general
  framework for understanding the influence of local climate and demography on dietary
  change across human history.
