abstract: El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic disruption of coupled
  oceanic-atmospheric conditions in the tropical Pacific, which changes global precipitation
  regimes. One area strongly affected by positive (el Niño) phases is the Pacific
  Coast of South America. The specific effects of ENSO on Andean ecological communities
  have received little attention, however. We examine vegetation gross primary productivity
  (GPP) on Peru's north coast arid-lands during a recent (2016--2017) el Niño, using
  a time series of Sentinel 2 imagery. By comparing GPP time-series in three agricultural
  subregions and three endemic desert vegetation communities, we demonstrate that
  levels of primary productivity in desert regions during ENSO-positive phases meet
  or exceed thresholds of adjacent agricultural lands. These results, the first that
  quantify and spatialize changing GPP between ENSO-neutral and ENSO-positive phases
  for South American arid-land biomes, both outline the scale and distribution of
  the el Niño effects on terrestrial ecosystems and highlight the resulting opportunities
  for human inhabitants. The dramatic changes to endemic vegetation on the normally
  hyperarid coastal desert of Peru revealed by reconstructed GPP suggest that periodic
  el Niño precipitation plays a critical role in arid land ecodynamics by enhancing
  establishment, green growth, and seedbank development. These findings improve our
  understanding of ENSO's net effects and highlight the roles of abrupt climate events
  in the arid land ecology of NW South America.
