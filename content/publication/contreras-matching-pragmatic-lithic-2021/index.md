abstract: The documentation and analysis of archaeological lithics must navigate a
  basic tension between examining and recording data on individual artifacts or on
  aggregates of artifacts. This poses a challenge both for artifact processing and
  for database construction. We present here an R Shiny solution that enables lithic
  analysts to enter data for both individual artifacts and aggregates of artifacts
  while maintaining a robust yet flexible data structure. This takes the form of a
  browser-based database interface that uses R to query existing data and transform
  new data as necessary so that users entering data of varying resolutions still produce
  data structured around individual artifacts. We demonstrate the function and efficacy
  of this tool (termed the Queryable Artifact Recording Interface [QuARI]) using the
  example of the Stelida Naxos Archaeological Project (SNAP), which, focused on a
  Paleolithic and Mesolithic chert quarry, has necessarily confronted challenges of
  processing and analyzing large quantities of lithic material.
