abstract: The landscape around the prehistoric Peruvian ceremonial center of Chavín
  de Huántar has undergone extensive geomorphic and anthropogenic change since the
  beginning of monumental construction at the site in approximately 1200 BCE. Archaeological
  and geomorphic stratigraphy from the site and its near periphery provide the data
  necessary to characterize these changes in detail. This paper reports on the use
  of GIS-based interpolation tools to approximate a complex prehistoric land surface
  using unevenly scattered point data. Such an interpolated surface serves as the
  basis for the reconstruction of the pre-Chavín landscape and assessment of landscape
  change contemporary with the site.
