abstract: Ritual is broadly accepted as an important locus of social interaction in
  the pre-Hispanic Central Andes, and research into the development of durable sociopolitical
  inequality in the region often focuses on the social and political roles of public
  rituals. At the Middle-Late Formative Period (ca. 1200--400 BCE) monumental center
  of Chavín de Huántar, as well as at contemporary sites, ritual has long been hypothesized
  to include the use of psychoactive plants. However, neither psychoactive plant remains
  nor chemical traces of psychoactive compounds in likely ritual contexts have been
  identified at any of these sites. Recently excavated deposits sealed in an underground
  gallery at Chavń contained twenty-three artifacts of forms (especially bone tubes)
  associated with consumption of psychoactive plants elsewhere in the region. We here
  report, based on independent microbotanical and chemical analyses, two kinds of
  direct evidence for use of psychoactive plants in institutionalized ritual at Chav'.́
  These results are direct evidence of psychoactive plants in archaeological bone
  tubes used as inhalers and the northernmost direct evidence of vilca and Nicotiana
  use in the pre-Hispanic Andes.
