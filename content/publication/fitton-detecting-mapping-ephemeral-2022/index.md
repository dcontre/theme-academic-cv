abstract: Common assumptions about the ephemeral archaeological signature
  of pastoralist settlements have limited the application of geophysical techniques
  in the investigation of past herding societies. Here, the authors present a geophysical
  survey of Luxmanda, Tanzania, the largest-known settlement documented for the Pastoral
  Neolithic era in eastern Africa (c. 5000-1200 BP). The results demonstrate the value and potential of fluxgate gradiometry for
  the identification of magnetic anomalies relating to archaeological features, at
  a category of site where evidence for habitation was long thought to be undetectable.
  The study provides comparative data to enable archaeologists to identify loci for
  future investigations of mobile populations in eastern Africa and elsewhere.
