abstract: Abstract  Attention to human-environment relationships in the Central Andes
  has a long history. Although the area is not a neat microcosm of the globe, wholly
  representative of worldwide trends in the archaeology of human--environment interactions,
  it has been the site of both seminal investigations in archaeology and a substantial
  body of recent work that investigates themes of broad archaeological relevance.
  Specifically, central Andean environments have been variously conceived as structuring,
  modified, and sacred. These approaches to some extent reflect broad trends in archaeology,
  while also suggesting directions in which the archaeology of human-environment
  interactions is moving and highlighting archaeology's relevance to discussions of
  contemporary human-environment interactions. This article characterizes concepts
  that are key for describing central Andean environments and considers the ways in
  which the particular ecology of the Central Andes has informed archaeological research
  in the region. The example of the central Andes highlights the importance of understanding
  environments as dynamic, considering both geomorphic and anthropogenic contributors
  to that dynamism, and examining both ecological ("environment") and ideological
  ("landscape") implications of archaeological landscapes.
