abstract: A wealth of remotely sensed data has accumulated over the past several decades
  and now constitutes an analytical resource primed for archaeological applications.
  To date, remotely sensed big data (RSBD) analytics in archaeology have focused on
  filling spatial gaps in the distribution of sites and features, characterizing environmental
  landscapes, and monitoring cultural heritage sites. The scientific promise of these
  data to expand our understanding of past human-environment interactions has not
  been fully realized. Limitations of data access, sufficient analytical and computational
  resources, and methodological awareness and education on the appropriate use of
  RSBD have limited the adoption and widespread use of RSBD in archaeology, despite
  its ubiquity in the Earth sciences. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a freely available
  planetary-scale cloud computing platform that addresses the perennial challenges
  of data access, analysis, and computing power that are particularly acute among
  archaeologists aiming to derive insights from RSBD. GEE lowers the barrier to entry
  for analyzing RSBD, expanding the potential for these data in the automated identification
  of archaeological features through deep learning; fieldwork planning and archaeological
  practice; modeling of past environments and environmental variability; and cultural
  heritage impact and risk assessments. In doing so, it also contributes to open science
  via increased access, transparency, and reproducibility.
