abstract: 'This paper revives a fascinating debate: did a drought start before, during,
  or after the collapse of the Andean polity of Tiwanaku? Here we present an alternate
  age model that highlights the real issue: the data from Lake Orurillo, no matter
  the age model, are too imprecise to address the question. The authors neglect the
  significance of four-century error ranges (95% probability) for a drought that lasted
  a single century, according to their estimates. They are content to treat an imprecise
  correlation between drought and collapse as a causal relationship. Future efforts
  will require much greater attention to refining both paleoclimate and cultural chronologies,
  which is a necessary first step in understanding complex episodes of human--environment
  interaction.'
