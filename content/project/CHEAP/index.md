CHEAP is an interdisciplinary initiative that combines archaeological field survey and absolute dating methods with paleolimnological analysis and geospatial modeling to develop a dynamic, human-scale, and historically-based reconstruction of how past societies in the Chicama Valley adjusted agricultural strategies to accommodate climate change.  

The major goals of this project are to:
1)	Integrate existing archaeological survey records into a cohesive geospatial database,
2)	Improve the absolute chronologies of these records to document diachronic settlement changes, 
3)	Reconstruct paleo-hydroclimatic within the greater Chicama watershed, to understand how short-term (less than centennial) climate shifts directly impacted water availability in the study region,  
4)	Create a dynamic agroecological model that integrates remote sensing observational data of recent climate-related ecological change and historic data (archaeological and climatic), and
5)	Use this integrated model to understand how groups changed agricultural strategies with past climatic changes.
