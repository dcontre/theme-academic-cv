	abstract = {Anatolian obsidian is ubiquitous, but present in only scant amounts, in lithic assemblages recovered from Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) settlements of the southern Levant. These sparse quantities have long been interpreted to indicate down-the-line exchange of obsidian via larger regional exchange systems that underpinned information flow amongst early food- producing societies. Here, we explore these networks in the southern Levant through analyses of obsidian artifacts from the PPNA site of el-Hemmeh, Jordan. EDXRF spectroscopy indicates that the obsidian used at el-Hemmeh originated from East G{\"o}ll{\"u} Da{\u g} in central Anatolia, echoing a pattern observed at other southern Levantine sites. We combine obsidian sourcing data for other PPNA sites in southwest Asia with assemblage structure and techno-typological data, to draw out previously unrecognized regional differences in obsidian consumption patterns. This allows us to argue for the existence of distinct exchange networks connecting the inhabitants of the southern Levant and the Middle Euphrates to Anatolian obsidian sources. We conclude that southern Levantine communities accessed their East G{\"o}ll{\"u} Da{\u g} obsidian via a trans-Lebanon and/or maritime route rather than through contemporary communities in the Middle Euphrates.},

@article{contrerasLandscapeEnvironmentInsights2010,
	abstract = {Abstract  Attention to human--environment relationships in the central Andes has a long history. Although the area is not a neat microcosm of the globe, wholly representative of worldwide trends in the archaeology of human--environment interactions, it has been the site of both seminal investigations in archaeology and a substantial body of recent work that investigates themes of broad archaeological relevance. Specifically, central Andean environments have been variously conceived as structuring, modified, and sacred. These approaches to some extent reflect broad trends in archaeology, while also suggesting directions in which the archaeology of human--environment interactions is moving and highlighting archaeology's relevance to discussions of contemporary human--environment interactions. This article characterizes concepts that are key for describing central Andean environments and considers the ways in which the particular ecology of the central Andes has informed archaeological research in the region. The example of the central Andes highlights the importance of understanding environments as dynamic, considering both geomorphic and anthropogenic contributors to that dynamism, and examining both ecological (``environment'') and ideological (``landscape'') implications of archaeological landscapes.},

@article{contrerasMatchingPragmaticLithic2021,
	abstract = {The documentation and analysis of archaeological lithics must navigate a basic tension between examining and recording data on individual artifacts or on aggregates of artifacts. This poses a challenge both for artifact processing and for database construction. We present here an R Shiny solution that enables lithic analysts to enter data for both individual artifacts and aggregates of artifacts while maintaining a robust yet flexible data structure. This takes the form of a browser-based database interface that uses R to query existing data and transform new data as necessary so that users entering data of varying resolutions still produce data structured around individual artifacts. We demonstrate the function and efficacy of this tool (termed the Queryable Artifact Recording Interface [QuARI]) using the example of the Stelida Naxos Archaeological Project (SNAP), which, focused on a Paleolithic and Mesolithic chert quarry, has necessarily confronted challenges of processing and analyzing large quantities of lithic material. ,  La documentaci{\'o}n y an{\'a}lisis de materiales l{\'\i}ticos tiene que navegar una tensi{\'o}n entre examinar y documentar artefactos individuales o sumas de artefactos.

	abstract = {A wealth of remotely sensed data has accumulated over the past several decades and now constitutes an analytical resource primed for archaeological applications. To date, remotely sensed big data (RSBD) analytics in archaeology have focused on filling spatial gaps in the distribution of sites and features, characterizing environmental landscapes, and monitoring cultural heritage sites. The scientific promise of these data to expand our understanding of past human-environment interactions has not been fully realized. Limitations of data access, sufficient analytical and computational resources, and methodological awareness and education on the appropriate use of RSBD have limited the adoption and widespread use of RSBD in archaeology, despite its ubiquity in the Earth sciences. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a freely available planetary-scale cloud computing platform that addresses the perennial challenges of data access, analysis, and computing power that are particularly acute among archaeologists aiming to derive insights from RSBD. GEE lowers the barrier to entry for analyzing RSBD, expanding the potential for these data in the automated identification of archaeological features through deep learning; fieldwork planning and archaeological practice; modeling of past environments and environmental variability; and cultural heritage impact and risk assessments. In doing so, it also contributes to open science via increased access, transparency, and reproducibility.},

The authors neglect the significance of four-century error ranges (95\% probability) for a drought that lasted a single century, according to their estimates. They are content to treat an imprecise correlation between drought and collapse as a causal relationship. Future efforts will require much greater attention to refining both paleoclimate and cultural chronologies, which is a necessary first step in understanding complex episodes of human--environment interaction.},

Their construction coincides with the spread of pastoralism into the region during a period of profound climate change. Early work at the Jarigole pillar site suggested that these places were secondary burial grounds. Subsequent excavations at other pillar sites, however, have revealed planned mortuary cavities for predominantly primary burials, challenging the idea that all pillar sites belonged to a single `Jarigole mortuary tradition'. Here, the authors report new findings from the Jarigole site that resolve long-standing questions about eastern Africa's earliest monuments and provide insight into the social lives, and deaths, of the region's first pastoralists.},

@article{storozumInfluenceAncientHerders2021,
	abstract = {In eastern Africa, ecologists have found that when mobile pastoralists abandon their temporary encampments, the accumulation of burned animal dung, wood, and other organic waste enriches the concentration of nutrients (e.g., calcium, phosphorous, magnesium) essential to soil health, in comparison to other soils without prior human habitation. These nutrient-enriched soils promote glade development and greater biodiversity. Geoarchaeological research on the time depth of this anthropogenic ``nutrient hotspot'' phenomenon has demonstrated that soils at several archaeological sites in southern Kenya still remain enriched in these soil macro- and micro- nutrients after several thousand years. However, soil scientists and geoarchaeologists do not yet understand how these anthropogenic soils vary over the extensive geographic conditions of eastern Africa. The discovery of a Pastoral Neolithic site (ca. 3000 BP) at Luxmanda on the Mbulu Plateau, Tanzania, provides an opportunity to examine if similar patterns of nutrient enrichment can be detected in a different geological and climatic zone.In this paper, we use geochemical and sedimentary analyses to determine how archaeological soils at Luxmanda differ from adjacent off-site soils and known archaeological soils in Kenya, as well as from computationally derived soil nutrient models for eastern Africa. Our results indicate that soils derived from anthropogenic sediments and ashy dung are 4 to 16-fold more abundant in soil macro nutrients relative to off-site or modeled values. This pattern fits previous studies' observations thatelevated macro- and micro-nutrients in soils are strongly correlated with ancient pastoralist habitation sites. We conclude that anthropogenic soils found at Pastoral Neolithic archaeological sites may be a valuable, but unappreciated, soil resource in eastern Africa.},

One area strongly affected by positive (el Ni{\~n}o) phases is the Pacific Coast of South America. The specific effects of ENSO on Andean ecological communities have received little attention, however. We examine vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) on Peru's north coast arid-lands during a recent (2016--2017) el Ni{\~n}o, using a time series of Sentinel 2 imagery. By comparing GPP time-series in three agricultural subregions and three endemic desert vegetation communities, we demonstrate that levels of primary productivity in desert regions during ENSO-positive phases meet or exceed thresholds of adjacent agricultural lands. These results, the first that quantify and spatialize changing GPP between ENSO-neutral and ENSO-positive phases for South American arid-land biomes, both outline the scale and distribution of the el Ni{\~n}o effects on terrestrial ecosystems and highlight the resulting opportunities for human inhabitants. The dramatic changes to endemic vegetation on the normally hyperarid coastal desert of Peru revealed by reconstructed GPP suggest that periodic el Ni{\~n}o precipitation plays a critical role in arid land ecodynamics by enhancing establishment, green growth, and seedbank development. These findings improve our understanding of ENSO's net effects and highlight the roles of abrupt climate events in the arid land ecology of NW South America.},

	abstract = {Explaining the factors that influence past dietary variation is critically important for understanding changes in subsistence, health, and status in past societies; yet systematic studies comparing possible driving factors remain scarce. Here we compile the largest dataset of past diet derived from stable isotope {$\delta$}13C‰ and {$\delta$}15N‰ values in the Americas to quantitatively evaluate the impact of 7000 years of climatic and demographic change on dietary variation in the Central Andes. Specifically, we couple paleoclimatic data from a general circulation model with estimates of relative past population inferred from archaeologically derived radiocarbon dates to assess the influence of climate and population on spatiotemporal dietary variation using an ensemble machine learning model capable of accounting for interactions among predictors. Results reveal that climate and population strongly predict diet (80\% of {$\delta$}15N‰ and 66\% of {$\delta$}13C‰) and that Central Andean diets correlate much more strongly with local climatic conditions than regional population size, indicating that the past 7000 years of dietary change was influenced more by climatic than socio-demographic processes. Visually, the temporal pattern suggests decreasing dietary variation across elevation zones during the Late Horizon, raising the possibility that sociopolitical factors overrode the influence of local climatic conditions on diet during that time. The overall findings and approach establish a general framework for understanding the influence of local climate and demography on dietary change across human history.},
